# Introduction

Picture this scenario: You've just discovered a new car model, and almost like magic, it appears all around you – driving down streets, in TV ads, and your neighbor even drives one now. This experience is known as the *Baader-Meinhof* phenomenon. It’s a phenomenon where something you recently learned seems to appear everywhere, making it feel like it’s more common than it is.

In this article, we'll delve into the science behind this fascinating phenomenon. But before that, let's start with some history.

# Historical Origins and Naming

The [Baader-Meinhof Gang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Army_Faction), also known as the *Red Army* Faction, was a terrorist group in West Germany during the 1970s. Now, you might wonder how the name of this terrorist organization is associated with the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon.

In an online discussion board in the mid-1990s. Someone learned about the Baader-Meinhof Gang and then encountered several references to it in a short period. In the absence of an established term, this concept became colloquially known as the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon, a name that has since persisted.

# Psychological Mechanics Behind the Phenomenon

The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon or frequency illusion is a type of *cognitive bias*: an error in thinking that occurs while processing and interpreting information, that affects our perception of the frequency of objects, words, or events.

There are two key mechanisms involved in the Baader–Meinhof phenomenon:

## 1.Selective attention

Our brains input enormous amounts of information from our environment every day. But we don't give them attention equally. If we did, they would be constantly overwhelmed. To be more efficient, our brain selects the most useful information depending on the context or the task at hand and disregards all the information that we don’t need.

Thanks to selective attention, we can focus on what matters, filtering out less important details. For this reason, we tend to notice the things that interest us more i.e. a specific word or car—and ignore the rest.

## 2.Confirmation bias

Confirmation bias is the tendency to favor information that confirms or strengthens our beliefs and values. It enhances the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon further by making us look for things in our environment that support our preconceived ideas e.g. we seek environmental “proof” that suddenly everyone is driving a Toyota. At the same time, confirmation bias leads us to disregard any information that doesn’t align with those preconceived ideas.

# Real-Life Examples

During the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, doctors worldwide observed a surge in patients with swollen, discolored toes, quickly linking it to COVID-19 due to the concurrent timing, but later research revealed a lower incidence of COVID among these patients, demonstrating a misinterpretation influenced by the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon. This phenomenon led to the mistaken belief that the co-occurrence of these symptoms was more frequent than it was, highlighting the impact of recent observations on perception.

After learning about a rare, painless gastrointestinal disease, a doctor in training diligently studies it and, applying this new knowledge, successfully identifies two cases of the disease during endoscopies within 24 hours, demonstrating the practical application of the Baader-Meinhof phenomenon in medical diagnosis.

# Final Thoughts

The Baader-Meinhof phenomenon is a fascinating reminder of how our perceptions can be shaped by recent experiences, highlighting the subtle ways our brain connects and emphasizes new information. Now that you're aware of this phenomenon, don't be surprised if you start noticing it more often in your daily life.
