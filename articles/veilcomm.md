# Overview

Veilcomm demonstrates how the Tor protocol works by implementing its core components. Built with Rust and React, it provides both a functional backend and a visual interface to understand anonymous communication networks. This is a partial implementation and made for educational purposes only. [Go to source code](https://github.com/nader0913/veilcomm)
